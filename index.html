                        Yearly Trends of <br>Journalist Fatalities <br>Across Countries
                    </div>
                    <div class="des-subtitle">Peaks vs. Persistent Threats</div>
                    <div class="text">The annual trends in journalist fatalities across countries reveal distinct
                        patterns over time, vividly depicted by the line chart, which underscores stark differences in
                        the dynamics of journalist deaths. Two overarching patterns emerge. Firstly, there are
                        noticeable peaks in conflict zones, exemplified by countries like Syria, Ukraine, Israel, and
                        Gaza, experiencing striking spikes in journalist fatalities during specific years. These peaks
                        are often linked to periods of heightened conflict or war, exposing journalists to increased
                        risks as they report on the frontlines. The chart visually emphasizes the intensity and sporadic
                        nature of these incidents. Conversely, regions such as Mexico, the Philippines, Iraq, and
                        Colombia depict a more constant trend of journalist fatalities. The consistent line trajectory
                        signifies an ongoing and pervasive threat faced by journalists in these areas, highlighting the
                        challenges they confront in environments characterized by long-standing issues.

                    <div class="des-subtitle">Murder as the Dominant Cause</div>
                    <div class="text">Diving into the Context of Journalist Fatalities reveals a stark reality depicted
                        by the Sankey
                        diagram, where the cause of death among journalists is strikingly skewed. Surprisingly, murders
                        stand out as the primary threat, surpassing incidents of crossfire and all other factors
                        combined.
                        Within the category of murder, a nuanced examination reveals three main culprits: political
                        groups,
                        criminal organizations, and government officials. Unlike the relatively straightforward
                        attribution
                        of military officials in crossfire incidents, the murder category exposes a multifaceted
                        landscape
                        of danger, with political motives, criminal agendas, and governmental involvement emerging as
                        prominent contributors. This nuanced analysis sheds light on the intricate web of risks faced by
                        journalists, highlighting the need for a comprehensive understanding of the varied threats they
                        encounter in the pursuit of truth.</div>
